# TIoTA_artifacts
This repository contains samples of project artifacts generated from the specification of the generic Trusted Internet of Things Architecture (TIoTA) to protect sensitive data in fog/cloud-based IoT applications.

A practical experimentation is presented in a previous publication, titled "Achieving Data Dissemination with Security using FIWARE and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)", available on https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538590.
